# dat.gui-midi-control

`STATUS: Experimental`

dat.gui with added functionality for controlling params with a midi device.

This is something I use for personal projects and will not be maintained as a proper library. Use at own risk.

If you want something maintaned, have a look at [`gregsadetsky/dat.gui.midi`](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/dat.gui.midi).
